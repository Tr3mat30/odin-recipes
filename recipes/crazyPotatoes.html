            once you have everything ready, proceed to season all the meats to your liking, except the bacon because it
            is already has its own salt</li>
        <li>Now, it's time to chop the pepper and onion, while I heat a frying pan and the first thing you're going to
            add is the bacon so that it works as a kind of oil, put the chicken, remove the bacon and after the bacon is
            well cooked chicken, add pork and beef. Now put the pepper and onion, once everything is ready, remove.</li>
        <li>Finally, heat a frying pan if you want to make the fries or you can also make them in the oven, in a bowl
            put all the cooked meats together with the pepper and onion, stir everything very well and reserve. Now
            proceed to fry all the fries, this takes approximately 10 minutes once they are ready, serve on a plate and
            you are going to place all the meats, the melted cheese, the ranch on top and they are ready.</li>
